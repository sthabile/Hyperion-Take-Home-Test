** Section A - Option 1: Python Task**

Line 3 - There is a syntax error here. "result = {}" is part of the function therefore you need to indent. Always take note of indentation. 
		Python uses it to indentify a block of code.  

Line 5 - Think about why you are usingt the sorted() function, you need to specify what is being sorted. In this case I am assuming you are refering to the current string "i".
		 try x = "".join(sorted(i)).
			
Besides these two syntax errors, this solutions compiles, runs and it is correct. 
However, it is good practise to use descriptive variable names (not just x and i) and ask input from the user instead of hardcoding it (Look up the input() function).

This is an on-going project. 
The project has the following features:
	- Add a new employee
	- Update employee details
	- Delete an employee as desired
	

I am still to update the front-end of this project but the functionalities have been implemented already.
