**Running the solution**
This solution is coded in Java. There are no specific scripts required to run this. Simply open the project on inteliJ and run it.
Note: The program will keep running until it is closed. You do not have to run it for each input

**worst-case space complexity**
The complexity of this solution is constant. Regardless of the input size, the program will always loop either 10 or 13 times using the same amount of space, per run or per input.
